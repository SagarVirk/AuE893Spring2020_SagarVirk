Background: I was born in a Sikh family in the city of Chandigarh, in India on October 20, 1996. My father is a retired Mechanical Engineer and right now working on his own business and my mother is a Nursing head in a government hospital.

Educational experience: I did my Bachelor’s in Engineering with Honors in Mechanical Engineering from Panjab University, Chandigarh. I also did some certified courses in ANSYS Workbench Modules.

Work experience: My BE degree required me to complete eight months-long internships that can be done in three bifurcations. So, I decided to take two, month and a half long internship during the summer holidays. The first internship was under my college professor during which I made a system to measure fuel volume in an automobile fuel tank. My second internship was at an automobile manufacturing company SML ISUZU. I worked in their technology and tool design department, my job there was to model various equipment and tools involved in the manufacturing of a light-duty truck. My last internship which was 6 months long was at MINDA CORP. which is the biggest two-wheeler suppliers in India. I worked in their New Technology department and most of the work I did there is confidential but involves parts for various OEMs like BMW, Honda and Bajaj.

Coming to CU-ICAR: I aimed for studying in the college that had the right balance of excellent faculties and ample ongoing projects of my interest so, CU-ICAR was a natural choice. My interest lies Vehicle Dynamics and I want to mix it up with Controls and Electronics. CU-ICAR has a great facility for hands-on experience regarding building a car and that too with a systems overview and programs which are about the new trending technology so, choosing CU-ICAR was a no brainer.

MS/Ph.D.: I am a master’s student in Automobile engineering.

Career aspiration: I aspire to be a vehicle dynamics specialist working for an OEM’s Research and Development sector. During my work, I want to improve vehicle stability as well as safety and want to improve the responsiveness for the ones who like the thrill of driving. I also want to spend some time with track vehicles.

I don’t have any obligation for the country where I work provided that the opportunity is worth it.

Hobbies, passions: I love dogs (I have a German Shepard back at my home), I enjoy photography (yes, I do have a DSLR), I am a green belt in MMA would like to resume it once I am free, I like to go for a swim and have practiced it competitively also and I am also an anime/manga enthusiast

Repository: This repository's specific function is to serve as a workspace managment tool for my Autonomy Science and System class which will allow me to properly organize my data and will also help during team activities when I would need to get data from others and push data to other directories.
